# Voice Based Smartboard

Hello People !!

Let's have a quick glimpse of our project,

- Need statement :

"Design and Implement Voice Based Smartboard"


- Components used : Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth Module & 16x2 LCD. 
- Implementation :

  * Software Section :
  - Developed an App named STR (Speech and Text Recognition) using 'MIT App Inventor' for connecting with external Bluetooth module to transmit Text & Voice based messages.
  - Bugs present in Arduino code are troubleshooted.   


  * Hardware Section :

  - It uses Arduino Uno, a low-cost, open-source electronic prototyping platform,on which HC-05 BT module & 16x2 LCD is connected.
  - BT module & LCD are connected to arduino pins using M-F (Male to Female) jumper wires.
  - Arduino code is dumped & tested for various cases

Finally , After successful testing & validation, Wireless transmission of voice & text input is established & developed model is ready for deployment.

# Real World Application of Project

- Voice Based Smartboards are often used in public places such as bus stations, railway stations, airports, shopping malls, and parks.
  - Ex : It could be used to display train arrival and departure times, flight delays, or important safety announcements.

- Large scale implementation of this model can be used by businesses and organizations to communicate with employees and customers
  - Ex :  It can be used to display company policies, product updates, or upcoming events.
